            I am a Certified Pega Developer (CSA 8.8 & CSSA 8.8) with additional skills in Java, JDBC, Servlets, SQL, and web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I previously worked at CollabPartnerz as a Pega Developer Trainee (Intern), where I gained hands-on experience working on real-world Pega applications.
            
            Currently, Iâ€™m engaged in a freelance project and continuously upskilling in Pega Constellation and the MERN full-stack to stay aligned with modern development practices.
